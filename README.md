# Generative Image Inpainting for Watermark Removal + GUI

This is a fork of https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting (the official code release of inpainting with contextual attention https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07892) which attempts to implement the features described in their subsequent paper introducing Gated Convolutions (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03589.pdf) and some other experimental features such as multiresolution contextual attention.

We implemented a GUI to select the watermark region of a picture before processing.
